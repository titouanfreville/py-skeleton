## Concept

The aim of this repository is to provide a minimal setup for project in python. It uses a CRUD task manager to do so. The base of the project consit of a migration set to create and populate the database, a Makefile to run project tasks, and a set of configuration for tools, dependencies and the project.

## Clean architecture

Clean architecture is a concept revolving around Hexagonal and oinion architectured. It enforces concern separation and cleanly isolate your domain in a single place. I like to use it for long therm project as it is easy to change tools like frameworks or database technologie. The example in skeletton are minimalist and clean architecture is a large overkill for it as its a skeletton and not a demo.
